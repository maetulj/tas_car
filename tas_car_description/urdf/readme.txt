This folder includes the URDF description of the tas_car. In the include subfolder materials, macros and gazebo parameters are defined.

The car is assembled from the macros in the "tas_car_description.urdf.xacro" file. It uses the xacro format, therefore
it needs to be compiled into urdf before usage. This is done on the fly in the launch file.
